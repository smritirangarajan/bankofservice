🤝 Bank of Service
Bank of Service is a community-driven mobile app that connects those who need help with those who can provide it. Built using Xcode and Firebase, the platform redefines volunteering by introducing a credit-based system where time — not money — becomes the currency.

🌟 Project Overview
The Bank of Service serves as:

A volunteer opportunity portal for community organizations.

A platform for individuals to offer and receive help.

A service credit bank, where users earn hours through volunteering, which they can later redeem when in need.

Think of it as a “social security for services”: individuals contribute help when they are able and draw from their service credit bank when they need assistance later in life.

🔧 Key Features
🕒 Time Banking: Users start with 5 service hours and earn more by helping others.

🙋 Request & Offer Help: Add or remove requests to connect volunteers with those in need.

🏷️ Credit System: Earn service hours that can be used to request help in the future.

📣 Organization Portal: Acts as a platform for nonprofits and local groups to post volunteer opportunities.

✅ Volunteering Hours Tracker: Log time spent helping for recognition or verification.

🔥 Powered by Firebase: Real-time data updates and secure backend.

🧠 Why It Matters
Traditional systems like insurance and social security often fall short for underserved populations. Bank of Service creates a compassionate, inclusive alternative, where:

Every hour spent helping counts — regardless of race, gender, or income.

Users earn their support, encouraging dignity and mutual respect.

The model builds resilient, empathetic communities by paying it forward.
